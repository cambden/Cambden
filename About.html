    <p>About Us:</p>
    <div>
    <p>
      Founded in 1839, Virginia Military Institute  (VMI)  is the oldest  
      state-supported military college in the United States. Throughout its storied history,
       VMI has produced leaders and individuals whose daily lives reflect the integrity, 
       fairness, and appreciation for the value of hard work that is instilled at the 
       Institute. For the individual who wants an undergraduate experience more complete 
       and transformative than an ordinary college or university can provide and more 
       versatile in its applications than a military service academy affords, VMI offers 
       a superb education.
